# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing Walmart sales data to identify key sales trends, customer behavior, and profit insights. By utilizing **SQL** and **Power BI**, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to provide actionable insights into Walmart’s sales performance, helping drive better business decisions.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: For data querying, analysis, and generating insights
- **Power BI**: For data modeling and creating interactive dashboards
- **MS Excel**: For preliminary data validation and exploration

## Key Objectives:
- Analyze sales data to identify the top-performing customers, cities, and product subcategories.
- Track monthly sales and profit trends using SQL window functions and subqueries.
- Visualize profit distribution across states, product categories, and customer segments.
- Calculate shipment processing times and compare shipping efficiency across different regions.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains over **3,000** sales transactions with the following columns:
- **Order ID**, **Order Date**, **Ship Date**, **Ship Mode**, **Customer ID**, **Customer Name**
- **Sales**, **Quantity**, **Discount**, **Profit**, **Category**, **Sub-Category**, **Product Name**
- **Region**, **State**, **City**

## Key Analyses:
1. **Top 10 Customers**: Identified the top customers based on total sales and profit generated.
2. **City-Wise Performance**: Evaluated cities with the highest sales and profit margins.
3. **State-Wise Profit Distribution**: Visualized profit and loss across different states.
4. **Subcategory Sales**: Analyzed subcategories by orders and profit margins.
5. **Sales Trends**: Tracked monthly sales and profit trends using SQL window functions.
6. **Shipment Processing Times**: Calculated shipment delays and evaluated shipping efficiency.

## Power BI Dashboard:
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to:
- Visualize **profit distribution** across states using pie and bar charts.
- Highlight **sales trends** using line charts for monthly and quarterly sales.
- Showcase **customer segmentation** based on order quantity, sales, and profit.

The dashboard allows users to filter data by **regions**, **categories**, and **customer segments** to gain deeper insights into specific business areas.

## Project Results:
- Identified the **top 10 customers** who contributed significantly to sales.
- Recognized **cities and states** that delivered the highest sales and profit.
- Provided Walmart’s management with an overview of **product performance** across different categories and subcategories.
- Offered insights into **shipment efficiency**, highlighting regions with potential for improvement.

## Conclusion:
The **Walmart Sales Data Analysis** project delivered valuable business insights through detailed data analysis and visualizations. By leveraging SQL and Power BI, the analysis supported strategic decision-making and offered a comprehensive view of Walmart’s sales and profitability across different dimensions.

## How to Use:
1. **SQL Queries**: Review and execute the SQL queries in the `sql/` folder to analyze the sales data.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.
3. **Dataset**: The dataset used for the analysis can be found in the `data/` folder.

## Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate **predictive analysis** for forecasting future sales trends.
- Further segment customer data to analyze behavior by **demographic groups**.
- Explore **seasonal trends** by adding time-series analysis.
